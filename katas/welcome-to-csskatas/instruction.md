Greetings, my friend!

This is **CSSKatas dojo**.\
It's where we learn and practice CSS skills.

We do that by figuring out a way to reproduce the design on the right. <span class="not-italic">➡️</span>

You'll update the code in the editor below. <span class="not-italic">⬇️</span> \
And your can preview your updates in the right-bottom. <span class="not-italic">↘️</span>

If you want to know if your solution matches the design, click the `Check` button above. <span class="not-italic">↗️</span>

Now, let's start learning and practicing. <span class="not-italic">🥳</span>
