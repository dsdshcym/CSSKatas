To distinguish buttons from each other, we may need to give them different colors.\
Specifically, we'd set a button's background color and text color to make it beautiful.

Tailwind CSS class names are usually composed by 2 parts:

-   **Prefix:** Decide the scope of this class.

    For example:
    -   Classes start with `bg-` changes the background of this element.
    -   Classes start with `text-` changes the text within this element.

-   **Suffix:** Actually apply the style to that scope.

    For example:
    -   Classes ends with `-black` changes the color to black.\
        (no matter it's background color or text color)
    -   Classes ends with `-white` changes the color to white.\
        (no matter it's background color or text color)
