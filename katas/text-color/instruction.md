Tailwind CSS ships with a carefully-curated default color palette.
This palette provides enough colors for you to bring your app to life.
Yet the color choices are limited so you won't get overwhelmed when picking a color.
So your app will look more consistent.

Let's apply these colors to texts first.

Tailwind CSS class names are usually composed by 2 parts:

-   **Prefix:** Decide the scope of this class.

    Classes start with `text-` applies changes to the text within this element.

-   **Suffix:** Actually apply the style to that scope.

    Classes ends with `blue-500` changes the color to <span class="text-blue-500">rgb(59, 130, 246)</span>.
