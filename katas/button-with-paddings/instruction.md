To make a button, we need to add some spaces (paddings) between text and
border.

In Tailwind CSS, classes with prefix `px-` are utilities to control
horizontal paddings.

- `px-2` would add `0.5 rem (8 pixels)` padding to both left and right.
- `px-4` would add `1 rem (16 pixels)` padding to both left and right.

Similarly, classes with prefix `py-` controls vertical paddings.

- `py-2` would add `0.5 rem (8 pixels)` padding to both top and bottom.
- `py-4` would add `1 rem (16 pixels)` padding to both top and bottom.
