Font is as important as the content itself, different formats serve different purposes.

For example, bold font is considered to be more important than thin. Italic font attracts more attention than non-italic.

Tailwind CSS provides several utilities to control font in different aspects:

- Control font family with `font-{family}`:
  - `font-sans`
  - `font-serif`
  - `font-mono`

- Control font weight with `font-{weight}`, for example:
  - `font-thin`
  - `font-bold`

- Control font size with `text-{size}`, for example:
  - `text-xs`
  - `text-base`
  - `text-2xl` 

- Control font style with `italic` or `non-italic`.
