By using the text transform utilities, texts can be transformed to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize.
It's very easy to create a text-only logo by combining with text color utilties.

Utilities:

- `uppercase`, `lowercase` and `capitalize` do what their names say.
- Use `normal-case` to preserve the original casing.
