The Text Transform utilities change texts to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize.
Combined with Text Color utilities, it's very easy to create a text-only logo with HTML.

Utilities:

- `uppercase`, `lowercase` and `capitalize` do what their names say.
- Use `normal-case` to preserve the original casing.
