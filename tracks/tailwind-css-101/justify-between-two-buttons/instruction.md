Flexbox is a powerful tool to build responsive layouts.\
Adding `flex` class to a `div` would create a `flex` container.

Classes with prefix `justify-` controls how elements in a flex container are positioned.

- `justify-center` would justify elements along the center.
- `justify-between` would make sure there are equal spaces around each element.
