Ring utilities are used to apply solid box-shadow to an element.

- Use the `ring-{width}` utilities to apply solid box-shadow of a specific thickness to an element. Rings are a semi-transparent blue color by default, similar to the default focus ring style in many systems.
- You can also control the color with `ring-{color}` utilities.
