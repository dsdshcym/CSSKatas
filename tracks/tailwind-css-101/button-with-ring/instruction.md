Ring utilities are used to apply solid box-shadow to an element.

- Use the `ring-{width}` utilities to apply solid box-shadow of a specific thickness to an element. 
- Rings are semi-transparent blue by default, similar to the default focus style used by many browsers. You may use `ring-{color}` utilities to control the color.
